# Stream Spike

## Description

This project outlines the usage of node streams. I thought it would be a more complicated, but we ended up with a basic example reading from a csv file.

## Installation

Run `npm i` to all the required npm dependencies.

## Usage

Run `npm start` to run the script.

## Folder Structure

This project consists of two files:

- `src/index.ts`: the script with all the implementation for this project.
- `data.csv`: a spreadsheet with 200 inventory items
